      To initialize the PPGSO branch and eliminate Atom's fixation on the entire core demos treeUsing
      I did something like this

      In Atom
        new branch

      In commandline
        git init in this directory
        git remote add https://github.com/jonschull/Lyte

      In Atom
        Publish

      Apparently to update you need to
        stage
        then commit
        then Push

    installed Terminal (right click or see icon at bottom left)
  June 24
    installed pythonIDE
    pyInstall and lyte no longer choke on purePython files that import pythonize
    Changed Themes via settings
  June 25 separation of concerns (but confusing flow.  need to diagram and refactor)
    expt.html is all generic
    notyet.js contains the specific inclusions of python runCode

    expt.html defines pyInstall and compileThis and getSource

    notyet.js
      uses pyInstall->compileThis -> doMain() to import utils.py filterImports
      uses notyet.js/notyet()
        to getSource and filterImports to populate the GSO editor
        and then asks GlowScript to runCode()
  June 26.  glitch-compatible index.html created for PPGSO
    Fetch in glitch was choking on long-named python files
      (like "PPGSOincrementallayout.html")

    now struggling to create new repo realstuff
    perhaps I'm good now?
  June 28   lean mean, and incremental.
          now I should be able to do newChild = birth(parentID)
          have birth update params[edgeIDs] and nodes
          and run(nodes, params) again and again



Other Notes:  Keep these true
  Folding Text in Atom Alt Cmd [ and ]; also ^K and ^L via keyboard maestro

  Notes for Bruce

    it would be nice if vpython re-used the browser-window  last used instead of opening a new window
